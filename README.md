A new flutter project

## Introduction
Keeping track of your habits is very important. We often create habits by reminding us of adults, keeping in mind and doing. However, in today's busy age, we don't have much time to memorize all the routines we need to do. Therefore, forming a new habit such as reading, drinking enough water, exercising, ... is very difficult.
In era of technology, a lot of applications that support people's lives are developed. However, we find that there are still very few developed applications of habit tracking software, and they also have many limitations.
Recognizing this problem, we offer a habit tracking software product. With outstanding features such as:
- Create a separate account for each user, so that they can easily use the application on multiple technology devices
- Schedule reminders to perform routines
- Create challenges that users can try to achieve
- Statistics of the number of habits performed
- Friendly interface
- Easy to use
